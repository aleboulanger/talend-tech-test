 * You have a triangle like the following:
 * <pre>
 *              7
 *            3   8
 *          8   1   0
 *        2   7   4   4
 *       4  5   2   6  5
 * </pre>
 *
 * You have to find the biggest sum of numbers by following a path from the top to the bottom of the triangle.
 * During each step, you can go to the diagonal down right or the diagonal down left.
 * In this example, the max sum is 30 (7 > 3 > 8 > 7 > 5)
